# Group Project Web SheTalk

This Project is [Final Project Fullstack Web Development](https://github.com/impactbyte/full-stack-web-assignments/tree/master/Final-Project-Fullstack-Web-development) from the Skilvul Bootcamp Full Stack Web Development (Bootcamp Perempuan Inovasi 2023).
I built this website with my team using ReactJS, Redux, Bootstrap, ExpressJ, MySQL. 
**The code for the client-side can be found on the front-end branch, while the code for the server-side is located on the back-end branch**
